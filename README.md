## Detail

I use github for online storage of my smallish projects. I don't expect many people to use them as they tend to be simple but still buggy.

I have created 2 small coin mods ( 1 bedrock & unpublished, the other one is a [1.21.1 Fabric coin mod](https://github.com/Felix-Galle/coin-mod-1.21.1)) as well as other things (also not published).
I like making small macro-like things just for me and my family, e.g. [automation](https://github.com/Felix-Galle/automation_v2) (no longer being updated, I couldn't get it to function as I wanted) which is a simple automation project that uses electron (node.js) and python to create a quick file transfer software between mine and my other computer (and vice versa). 

#### Extra Notes

- All of my projects & software are under MIT License unless specified in the project. Use freely but be aware that I may decide to private or archive some of the software if I choose to.
- Ff you experience any errors with my software just send an issue message, and I'll try to sort it out.

###### Disclaimers

I tend to forget to prood read and there may be mistakes in my writing. I'm sorry for any confusion I may cause/have caused.

My commit messages usually end up being complete jargon. I apologise for any confusion I may cause/have caused.

I also tend to be coding late into the night so I may commit & push stuff at 3 or 4 o'clock in the morning :D

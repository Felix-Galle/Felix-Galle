  I've had to use a couple for previous school and persona projects but I don't know enough about them for it to be useful.

## Detail

I use github for online storage of my small projects. I don't expect many people to use them as they tend to be simple but still buggy.
I play Minecraft far too often and have recently gotten into coding small mods for them. I have already created 2 small coin mods (1 of which was done for bedrock, but not published on github) as well as other things (also not published).
I like making small macro-like things just for me and my family, e.g. [https://github.com/Felix-Galle/automation.git]

  I've had to use a couple for previous school and persona projects but I don't know enough about them for it to be useful.

## Detail

I use github for online storage of my small projects. I don't expect many people to use them as they tend to be simple but still buggy.
I play Minecraft far too often and have recently gotten into coding small mods for them. I have already created 2 small coin mods ( 1 bedrock & unpublished, the other one is a [1.21.1 Fabric coin mod](https://github.com/Felix-Galle/coin-mod-1.21.1)) as well as other things (also not published).
I like making small macro-like things just for me and my family, e.g. [automation](https://github.com/Felix-Galle/automation) which is a simple automation project that uses electron and python to create a quick file transfer software between mine and my other computer (and vice versa).
